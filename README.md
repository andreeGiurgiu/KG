# Hybrid Intelligence Ontology Project

This repository contains our work for the *Knowledge Graphs and Semantic Technologies* course, focused on ontology engineering, reasoning, and data analysis for Hybrid Intelligence systems.

## 📁 `ReportAnalysis/`

This notebook includes the main analysis conducted throughout the project:

- 📊 **Comparative analysis** between our original ontology and the `merge_ontology` provided in the course.
- 🔗 **Final merged ontology** combining our model with the class-provided ontology for the final assignment.
- 🔍 **SPARQL queries** used to explore, audit, and validate the semantic structure of the final ontology.
- 📈 **Graph metrics** (e.g., node/edge counts, class/property distributions) computed to assess the structural richness of the ontology.
- 🤖 **Link prediction experiments** using knowledge graph embeddings (ComplEx) to assess semantic completeness and suggest new triples.

## 📁 `FinalOntology/`

Contains our fully developed ontology, including all newly introduced classes, relationships, and individuals. This version represents our extended conceptual model for representing socio-technical and ethical dimensions in Hybrid Intelligence.

## 📁 `FinalCombine_graph/`

This refers to the **final merged ontology** used in the assignment, created by combining our ontology with those of all other project authors. This knowledge graph serves as the basis for reasoning tasks, semantic queries, and benchmarking.
